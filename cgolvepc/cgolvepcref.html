Many interesting Game of Life patterns have been omitted because of the web-based nature of this collection.
The patterns which were selected for inclusion here are organized into groups and subgroups to make file transfers small
and navigation fast.
<p>
<a href="http://www.collidoscope.com/cgolve/cgolvepc.zip">Download</a>
a copy of the CGOLVE pattern collection (about 250K). Enables viewing of the collection without the internet
and without the subgroups.
Unzip the distribution and double click the resulting cgolvepc.html file to view the
collection.
<p>
<a href="http://www.collidoscope.com/cgolve/pcauthor.zip">Download</a>
a copy of the tools used to create the CGOLVE pattern collection (about 80K). Enables creation and editing of
pattern collections, including the CGOLVE pattern collection. Provides a Windows tool (with C++ source) which creates
a new pattern collection from a directory of pattern files.
 Unzip the distribution and double click the resulting
pcauthor.html file to get started.
<P>
All files in the distributions may be modified and reproduced without restriction.

Alan Hensel's lifep and lifebc collections form the foundation of this site's pattern collection.
<li>
Jason Summers' many collections provided most of the newer patterns.
<li>
<A HREF="http://golly.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Golly</A> was used extensively to edit and analyze
patterns. If you like Conway's Game of Life you should have Golly.
<li>Dave Greene provided help and invaluable input.
<li>None of this would be possible without the people who discover, engineer, and catalog patterns.
